          <h2>Better Together Community Engine</h2>
          <p>
            The Better Together Community Engine (BTCE) is an open-source
            federated social platform. It allows people to create, join, and
            invite others to groups. People can have discussions, chat live,
            and share information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engine allows developers to integrate social features into
            their own applications with ease. There is currently a Ruby on
            Rails gem and a Django package versions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engine provides an extensible interface for
            modeling group dynamics. People and Groups are the primary object
            models, and are supported by other classes that allow for the
            representation of typical real-world scenarios. People can create
            groups and invite others to join. People who are part of a group
            are issued a Membership that allows tracking the start and end
            date of the membership, and in which role the person is part
            of the group.
