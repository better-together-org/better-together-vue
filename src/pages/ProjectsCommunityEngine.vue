          <h2>Better Together Community Engine</h2>
          <p>
            The Better Together Community Engine (BTCE) is an open-source
            community platform. It allows people to create, join, and
            invite others to public and private communities. People can have discussions, chat live,
            and share information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engine allows developers to integrate community features into
            their own applications with ease.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engine provides an extensible interface for
            modeling community dynamics. People and Communities are the primary object
            models, and are supported by other classes that allow for the
            representation of typical real-world scenarios. People can create
            communities and invite others to join. People who are part of a community
            are issued a Membership that allows tracking the start and end
            date of the membership, and in which role the person is part
            of the community.
