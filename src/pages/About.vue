            Better Together is a decentralized collaborative
            community. We are a solidarity and mutual-aid
            alliance of people & communities
            working together and
            supporting one another as we do what we can to
            make the world a better place.
          </p>

            We promote local resilience by encouraging
            people to be kind, communicate with and support one another, and
            share their knowledge, skills, resources and time.
