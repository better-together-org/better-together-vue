        <h2>Community Platforms</h2>
        <p>
          Better Together is building and maintaintaining open source
          public community infrastructure. Not just physical infrastructure as
          we're used to such as highways and bridges, but digital
          infrastructure, things like social networks, applications, tools for
          people to connect and share. We're working to build up a shared
          public community infrastructure, such as a version of Facebook that
          is community owned, for example, or a version of Amazon that's
          community owned.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are bringing people together and empowering people to participate
          in these processes that are normally held at a distance or behind
          closed doors. We want to allow people to have more control over and
          more understanding of what's going on in their communities and on
          the platforms they use, to educate people and empower people to
          participate, not just be consumers but be producers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects that we're working on currently include a local
          community platform called the Community Hub, which is available
          right now in the Labrador Straits, the Lower North Shore of Queb√©c
          and other areas as we attract new members and new participants. Our
          Community Commerce project is a community-owned e-commerce platform
          that empowers people to find the the products and services that are
          around them in their communities. For example, if you want to buy a
          book or a tool around you but you don't know which stores carry it.
          People and organizations will be able to have their own online
          stores within a larger network of our community marketplace, and
          make it accessible. This is just the first step, because we're also
          transitioning into an offering a Community Item Library, to be able
          to list the things that you have access to and you want to share,
          because we want to encourage caring and sharing. We know that it's
          through actually helping each other out, that we can make a big
          difference.
