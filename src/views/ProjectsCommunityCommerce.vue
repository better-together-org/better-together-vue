          The Better Together Community Commerce co-op platform allows
          members to tap into the community economy by bringing local
          shopping online!
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a part of the network allows people and organizations the
          convenience of shoping online while still supporting local
          businesses in their neighbourhood, city, region, or beyond!
        </p>
        <p>
          Buyers will discover the inventory of the stores around them and
          place an order for pick up or delivery. Local businesses would
          have the benefit of managing their inventory and showcasing it to
          the local community as well as offering expansion opportunities by
          tapping into the global e-commerce market.
        </p>

          Create your online store and you will get your own storefront to
          market to your customers as well as have your products
          appear in a platform-wide storefront along with those of other
          co-op members.
