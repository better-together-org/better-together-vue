          <h2>Better Together Community Engine</h2>
          <p>
            The Better Together Community Engine is an open-source plugin
            that allows developers to build community features into their
            apps with ease. There is currently a Ruby on Rails gem and a
            Django package version.
          </p>

          <p>
            The plugin specializes in providing an extensible interface for
            modeling group dynamics. People and Groups are the primary object
            models, and are supported by other classes that allow for the
            representation of typical real-world scenarios. People can create
            groups and invite others to join. People who are part of a group
            are issued a Membership that allows tracking the start and end
            date of the membership, and in which role the person is part
            of the group.
